# The SOLID principles
- five design principles that help make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles are widely used in object-oriented programming, including Swift.

ðŸ”¤ SOLID stands for:

| Letter | Principle                             | Meaning                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S      | Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) | One class should have one reason to change.                                  |
| O      | Open/Closed Principle (OCP)           | Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. |
| L      | Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)   | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.                         |
| I      | Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) | Prefer many specific interfaces over a single general-purpose one.           |
| D      | Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  | Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.                     |
