## üîê CAPC ‚Äî Content Access Policy Certificate (or Content Access Protection Certificate)

**CAPC** is a certificate or token that defines the content access policy.
It tells the DRM system how the content can be used ‚Äî whether it can be:

üì¶ Where You Might See SPC and CAPC

In DRM SDKs (e.g., Pallycon, Widevine Modular DRM), these are usually used when:
Generating license requests
Playing protected content
Setting up encryption during content packaging
For example, in Pallycon SDK (iOS/tvOS):
The SPC might be part of a request to the license server.
The CAPC (along with a license token) defines what playback is allowed and must match the player/device profile.
