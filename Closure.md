### What is a Closure in Swift?
- A closure is a self-contained block of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Closures can capture and store references to variables and constants from the context in which theyâ€™re defined.

| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What is a closure in Swift?**                | Explain what a closure is and how it's like a function.                                                          |
| **Difference between function and closure?**   | Closures are unnamed and can capture values; functions have names.                                               |
| **What is trailing closure syntax?**           | Used to improve readability when the last parameter is a closure.                                                |
| **Can closures capture values?**               | Yes, closures capture and store references to variables/constants from the surrounding context.                  |
| **What is a capture list in closures?**        | Used to define how values are captured (strong, weak, unowned).                                                  |
| **What is escaping vs non-escaping closure?**  | Escaping closures are stored and called later; non-escaping are called within the function body.                 |
| **What is autoclosure?**                       | Automatically creates a closure from an expression. Useful for delaying execution.                               |
| **How does retain cycle occur with closures?** | Closures capture self strongly, which may cause memory leaks. Use `[weak self]` or `[unowned self]` to avoid it. |
| **What are closure types?**                    | Global, nested, and capturing closures.                                                                          |
| **How to pass closure as parameter?**          | Like `(Int, Int) -> Bool` â€” a function type as a parameter.                                                      |
| **What is shorthand argument syntax?**         | Use `$0`, `$1` for quick inline closures without naming parameters.                                              |




**ðŸ“Œ How Closures Are Used in Swift**
| Use Case                   | Example                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **As callback handlers**   | For async operations like network calls, animations, etc.                    |
| **Sorting/filtering**      | `sorted(by:)`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce` all use closures.                   |
| **Event handling**         | In SwiftUI or UIKit, closures are used to handle button taps, gestures, etc. |
| **Custom logic**           | Pass custom logic to a function for flexible behavior.                       |
| **Functional programming** | Supports functional paradigms by treating functions as first-class citizens. |


**ðŸ§ª Code Example: Basic Closure**
```
let greet = { (name: String) in
    print("Hello, \(name)")
}
greet("Alice")

```
**ðŸ§ª Example: Closure as Callback**
```
func downloadData(completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
    // Simulate async work
    DispatchQueue.global().async {
        let result = "Data downloaded"
        completion(result)
    }
}

downloadData { result in
    print(result)
}
```

**Why do we use [weak self] in a closure?**
- When you capture self strongly inside a closure, the closure holds a strong reference to self, and if self also holds a strong reference to the closure (like in many async tasks, timers, or delegate patterns), it creates a retain cycle (strong reference cycle). This means neither self nor the closure can be deallocated, causing a memory leak. By using [weak self], you tell the closure to capture self weakly, breaking the strong reference cycle. This means:
self inside the closure becomes an optional (self?). If self is deallocated before the closure runs, the closure wonâ€™t crash but will see self as nil. Prevents memory leaks and allows self to be released properly.

Example with [weak self] (breaks retain cycle)
```
class MyViewController {
    func fetchData() {
        networkCall { [weak self] in
            guard let self = self else { return }
            self.updateUI()
        }
    }
    func updateUI() {
        print("UI updated")
    }
}

```
**Summary:**
- Use [weak self] in closures to avoid retain cycles and memory leaks when the closure captures self and self also holds the closure.
