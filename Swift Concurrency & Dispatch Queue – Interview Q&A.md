### üö¶ iOS Multithreading & Concurrency Guide


### Q 1. What is `DispatchQueue` in Swift?

`DispatchQueue` is a part of **GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)**, used to manage concurrent tasks in your app.

### Q 2. What is the difference between `main` and `global` queues?

| Queue         | Description                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DispatchQueue.main`  | Runs tasks on the **main thread**, used for UI updates.         |
| `DispatchQueue.global()` | Runs tasks on a **background thread**, ideal for heavy tasks. |

---


### Q 3. What is the difference between `async` and `sync`?

| Keyword | Behavior                                                    |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `async` | Executes the task **asynchronously** (non-blocking).        |
| `sync`  | Executes the task **synchronously** (blocking).             |

**Example** :
```swift 
DispatchQueue.global().async {
// Background thread
DispatchQueue.main.async {
// Back to main thread for UI updates
}
}
```


### Q 4. What is DispatchSemaphore?
DispatchSemaphore is used for synchronization between threads, controlling access to resources.

**Example** : 

```swift 
let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    semaphore.wait()  // ‚Üì wait for resource
    // critical section
    semaphore.signal() // ‚Üë release resource
}
```


### üîÑ From Dispatch Queues to Concurrency Concepts

### Q5. What is Concurrency?**
- Concurrency is the ability to run multiple tasks at overlapping time periods, not necessarily simultaneously.



### Q6. What is Parallelism?**
- Parallelism is the true simultaneous execution of multiple tasks using multiple cores.



### Q7. What is Context Switching?**
- Context Switching is the process of switching between threads or tasks, which incurs CPU overhead.

### **Advantage over each other:**

| **Aspect**                    | **GCD Advantages over NSOperation**               | **NSOperation Advantages over GCD**                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implementation**            | Very lightweight and simple to implement          | NSOperationQueue is complex and heavier                          |
| **Control on Operation**      | Limited control (no pause, resume, cancel easily) | You can pause, cancel, and resume operations                     |
| **Dependencies**              | No built-in support for dependencies              | Supports dependencies; operations wait until dependencies finish |
| **State Monitoring**          | Cannot monitor operation state                    | Can monitor states: ready, executing, finished                   |
| **Max Concurrent Operations** | No direct max operation limit control             | Can specify max number of concurrent operations                  |




### Q 8. ‚öôÔ∏è GCD vs NSOperation

| **Feature**       | GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) | NSOperation / OperationQueue                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Abstraction Level | Low-level, C-based API       | High-level, Objective-C / Swift API             |
| Customization     | Limited                      | Supports dependencies, priorities, cancellation |
| Reusability       | Hard to reuse blocks         | Can subclass NSOperation for reusable logic     |
| KVO Support       | ‚ùå No                         | ‚úÖ Yes                                         |
| Cancellation      | ‚ùå No (hard to cancel blocks) | ‚úÖ Yes                                        |





### Q 9. ‚úÖ Advantages and üö´ Disadvantages

| **GCD**                                         |  NSOperation                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Simple syntax                                | ‚úÖ Supports cancellation, dependencies          |
| ‚úÖ Lightweight                                  | ‚úÖ Better for complex task management           |
| üö´ No built-in cancellation                     | üö´ More boilerplate                             |
| üö´ Harder to manage complex dependencies        | üö´ Slightly heavier than GCD                    |




### Q 10. (Quality of Service) QOS 

| **QoS Class**       | **Priority**     | **Typical Use Cases**                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **userInteractive** | Highest priority | UI updates, animations, event handling                       |
| **userInitiated**   | High priority    | Tasks triggered by user actions needing quick results        |
| **utility**         | Low priority     | Downloads, file I/O, background computations with progress   |
| **background**      | Lowest priority  | Pre-fetching, backups, maintenance tasks that don‚Äôt block UI |


### Q 11. How GCD Schedules Tasks on the Global Queue Across Multiple CPU Cores?
- **Global Queue is Concurrent:** The global queue is a concurrent queue, meaning it can run multiple tasks at the same time.
- **System-Managed Thread Pool:** GCD maintains an internal thread pool managed by the system. It dynamically adjusts the number of threads based on system resources and workload.
- **Automatic Core Utilization:** When you dispatch tasks to the global queue, GCD schedules them across available CPU cores to maximize parallelism and performance.
- **Work Stealing and Load Balancing:** GCD uses work stealing to balance the load between threads. If one thread finishes its tasks early, it can "steal" tasks from busier threads to keep all cores busy.
- **Quality of Service (QoS) Influences Scheduling:** Tasks with higher QoS get preference on CPU time and resource allocation.
- **Context Switching Managed by System:** The OS handles context switching between threads to efficiently share CPU time when there are more tasks than available cores.
